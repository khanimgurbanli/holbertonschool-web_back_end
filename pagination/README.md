## Overview

This project includes a simple Python function designed to add two floating point numbers asynchronously. The function
is implemented to demonstrate basic asynchronous programming concepts in Python.

## Files

- `0-add.py`: Contains the `add` function, which performs addition of two floating point numbers.
- `test_add.py`: Contains unit tests for the `add` function, ensuring its correctness and functionality.

## Usage

1. **Define the Function**: Run `0-add.py` to define the `add` function.
2. **Test the Function**: Run `test_add.py` to execute tests and verify the functionality of the `add` function.

### Running the Project

To run the project, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python3 0-add.py
python3 test_add.py
